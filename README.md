A sleek and efficient app designed to streamline the spray coating process for researchers by offering customizable timers, cycle loops, progress tracking, and more! Whether you're in the lab or workshop, this app ensures you stay on track, optimizing your coating process with precision timing.


## **What is Spray Coating?** ðŸŽ¨

Spray coating is a widely used technique in various industries, including manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, and research, where a thin layer of material is applied to a surface using a spray gun or another spraying device. The material being sprayed could be anything from paint, polymers, adhesives, or specialized coatings designed for specific applications such as corrosion resistance, wear resistance, or aesthetics.

This method allows for precise, uniform coating and is particularly effective for complex or irregularly shaped surfaces where traditional coating methods (such as brushing or dipping) might not work as well. Itâ€™s commonly used for:

- **Protective Coatings**: Spray coating is often used to apply protective coatings to metal surfaces, preventing corrosion or rust formation.
- **Aesthetic Finishes**: Paint and other coatings are often applied to achieve a desired look or surface finish in products like cars, furniture, and electronics.
- **Functional Coatings**: Specialized coatings such as anti-slip, UV protection, or heat resistance are applied through spray coating for functional purposes in various devices, machinery, and infrastructure.

The key advantage of spray coating is its efficiency and the ability to handle large surfaces quickly and with a consistent result. Researchers often use this process for experiments that require controlled application of materials over a certain surface area or object.


## **Features** âœ¨

- **Six Customizable Timers**: One for each step of your spray coating process.
- **Cycle Looping**: Repeating processes? No problem! Loop your cycles to keep things rolling.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars show you how much time is left for each step and the full process.
- **Start/Reset Functionality**: Kick off the process with a tap, or reset everything with ease.
- **Clean UI/UX**: Simple, intuitive design to focus on what mattersâ€”timing your coating process.
